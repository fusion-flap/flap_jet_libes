@fibre_pos.txt
The data contained by this file refers to the position of the torus hall fibres on the pericope-beam:
  1. Torus hall fibre names.
  2. Vertical position-like numbers along the beam. They note the order of the fibres.
    Additionally, the distances between the adjacent fibres can be used in interpolation
    if no absolute fiber position is known because the corresponding fiber is not connected to KY6C.
    Cannot be simply converted to absolute positions in the tokamak, i.e. SI units.
  3. Distance from the axis of the beam in the poloidal plane containing the beam. In [mm].
